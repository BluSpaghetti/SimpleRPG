This is a small ongoing project to learn some C++ and, at the same time, to create something that people can enjoy.
Expect lots of errors and awful practices here.

# How to build
1. Navigate in the game path on a Windows cmd window (you need to see the 'src' folder)
2. Write "mingw32-make"
3. You did it :)
